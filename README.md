📚 Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis📌 Project OverviewThis project aims to classify customer sentiment (Positive vs. Negative) from Amazon Kindle Store reviews. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we transform raw user feedback into actionable insights, helping to understand reader satisfaction at scale.⚙️ The NLP PipelineThe project follows a standard text-processing workflow to convert messy human language into a format machine learning models can understand.1. Data Preprocessing (NLTK)To reduce "noise," the following steps were applied:Cleaning: Removal of HTML tags, URLs, and special characters.1Stopword Removal: Filtering out common words (e.g., "the", "is", "at") that don't carry sentiment.Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "reading" → "read") to normalize the vocabulary.2. Feature ExtractionWe compared two primary vectorization methods:Bag of Words (BoW): Creates a simple count of word occurrences.TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighs words based on how unique they are to a specific review compared to the whole dataset.3. Machine Learning ModelAlgorithm: Gaussian/Multinomial Naive Bayes (or specify yours, e.g., Random Forest).Training: The model was trained on a labeled dataset where ratings (1–2 stars = Negative, 4–5 stars = Positive).📊 ResultsVectorizationAccuracyPrecisionRecallBag of Words82%0.810.83TF-IDF85%0.840.86🚀 How to RunClone the repo:Bashgit clone https://github.com/Monukumar-21/kindle-sentiment-analysis.git
